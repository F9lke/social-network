# Social Network Application

A social network application built with the mern stack for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you the latest version of this project up and running on your local mashine for testing and development purposes. See deployment on how to deploy it on a live system. Please notice, that social-network is still under development.

### Prerequesites

* **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)** - A recent version of NodeJS, preferably PHP 8.11.2 or higher
* **MongoDB Instance** - [mlab](https://mlab.com/) is recommended

### Installing

A short guidance on how to setup the project on you local mashine.

After forfilling the prerequesites mentioned above, the project can be cloned with the following command in your git bash:

```
git clone https://github.com/F9lke/social-network
```

Thanks to the use of MongoDB, it is not necessary to manually create the database structure. In order to make this database system work on the other hand, you have to create a file called "keys.js" inside the folder "config" with the following code:

```
module.exports = {
    mongoURI: 'YOUR MONGODB URI',
    secretOrKey: 'secret'
}
```


### Known Bugs

Please notice, that this project is both under development and still in a very early state. That is why there are a few unfixed bugs that are getting worked on in the process.


**Bug 1** The first and thankfully only bug at this point of time involves the auth system; Currently it is possible to view the dashboard route without being logged in.



## Deployment

The installation on a live system does not differ much from the deployment on a local mashine. See installation for further notes.

## Contributing

It is highly appreciated to leave your thoughts and/or comitting your code related suggestions in order to improve code quality, project structure and functionality.

Since this project mainly focuses on self-study practice I rely on getting to know the right things at the right time. That is why I would go on to consider to list you under authors at event of help.
